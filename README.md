# Caveats

Remember, almost everything that happens in Git can be undone. Don't panic!

- If you mix `git merge` or `git pull` with `git pull --rebase` you will probably regret it.
- If you mix `git branch` and `git bd` you will probably regret it.
- If you move your branchdir base repo you will have to repair broken symlinks. Some of which are "supposed" to be broken.
